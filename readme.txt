Protect bbPress Forums, Topics and Replies using Groups.

== Description ==

*Groups bbPress* integrates [Groups](http://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/) and [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) so that all topics and replies related to protected forums are also protected automatically.

This additional plugin is necessary if you want to run member-only forums with bbPress and Groups. As the topics and replies in bbPress are custom post types, it is not sufficient to protect a forum using Groups.
The topics and replies in a protected forum would still be accessible unless they are also protected.
This plugin extends the access restrictions on a forum to its related topics.
This also applies to replies posted on topics: replies posted on a topic will be accessible to users who can access the topic and the forum only.
If additional access restrictions are set on a topic, its replies are protected by both the forum's and the topic's access restrictions.

[Groups Forums](http://www.itthinx.com/shop/groups-forums/) is an alternative to using [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) as your forum system with [Groups](http://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/).
